Got it 👍 — here’s a **task-style summary** you can send:

**Summary of Today’s Task:**

* Update `schemas.py` to replace `feedback_json` with `feedback`.
* Update `models.py` to align with the new column name.
* Modify `main.py` to reflect schema and model changes.
* Test database integration to ensure queries and API endpoints work correctly after changes.
* Add clear documentation/comments at the top of each file for better understanding.

Would you like me to also make this summary in a **very short one-liner** (like a quick manager update) or keep it detailed like above?
