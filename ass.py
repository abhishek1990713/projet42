Subject: Request for CMP Approval – Roles Not Defined Issue

Hi Arvind / Nisha,

The Codify backend team is currently facing an issue where some endpoints are returning the error “roles not defined.”

Michael has already raised a CMP request. Please find the CMP details below:

Sayeed CMP: shsiiwi11

Abhishek CMP: kshgev222b


Kindly review and approve the CMP at the earliest so that we can run these endpoints without any issues.

Please let me know if any additional information is required.

Thanks & Regards,
Abhishek
