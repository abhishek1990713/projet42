Here’s your full corrected and polished message with that part added:

**Hi Nikith,**

I’ll be sending an email on Monday regarding the confirmation of the input and output for the *field_level* and *feedback_report*.
In that email, I’ll include the input details (**application_id**, **start_date**, **end_date**) and the JSON output.
Please review and confirm over email if everything looks good or let me know if any changes are needed.

Also, **Rupali and I are waiting for your confirmation** — once you confirm, we’ll merge the code into the **develop** branch.

Would you like me to make it sound a bit more formal or keep it in this clear and polite tone?
