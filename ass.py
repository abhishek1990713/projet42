Subject: Issue Accessing Mandatory Leave Portal

Dear ICRM SG Central Program Compliance Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

While attempting to submit my Mandatory Leave through the portal, I encountered the following message:

“You are not required to take Country Requirement Leave in this compliance period.”

I believe this might be an error, as I was trying to complete the required compliance step.

I’ve attached a screenshot of the message for your reference.
Kindly look into this issue and advise on the next steps.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
