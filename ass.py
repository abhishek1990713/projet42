Here’s your corrected and polished message:

Hi Arvind, I’ve Got it! I can rewrite your full documentation in a **PowerPoint-style format**, focusing on **slides/sections**, **flow**, and **formulas**, without mentioning file names. Here's a clean version ready for presentation:

---

# **Slide 1: Title**

**Feedback Service API**
Collect, process, and analyze document feedback at **field-level and document-level**.

---

# **Slide 2: Overview**

**Purpose:**

* Capture field-level feedback for documents (e.g., passport, bill of lading).
* Calculate statistics and accuracy percentages.
* Provide high-level and detailed reports.

**Key Features:**

* Field-level feedback processing
* Document-wise accuracy calculation
* Aggregated reporting
* Logging for all operations

---

# **Slide 3: System Architecture**

**Flow:**

```
Client → API Endpoints → Service Layer → Database
                          ↑
                          └── Logger
```

**Components:**

* API Endpoints: Receive feedback & generate reports
* Service Layer: Calculates statistics
* Database: Stores feedback records
* Logger: Tracks all events

---

# **Slide 4: Database Structure**

**Feedback Table Columns:**

* **feedback_id**: Primary Key
* **correlation_id**: Unique correlation for each request
* **application_id**: Application reference
* **document_id**: Document reference
* **file_name**: File identifier
* **authorization_coin_id**: Security token
* **feedback_response**: Full JSON feedback
* **feedback_source**: Source of feedback
* **created_by / created_on**: User and timestamp
* **feedback_count**: Total fields with feedback
* **thumbs_up_count / thumbs_down_count**
* **docswise_avg_accuracy**: Document-level accuracy
* **document_type**: Type of document

---

# **Slide 5: Field-Level Feedback Formula**

**Field-Level Accuracy:**
[
\text{Field_Level_Accuracy} = \frac{\text{thumbs_up_count}}{\text{feedback_count}} \times 100
]

**Overall Status per Field:**

* `thumbs_up` if thumbs_up_count ≥ thumbs_down_count
* `thumbs_down` otherwise

---

# **Slide 6: Document-Level Accuracy**

**Document Accuracy Formula:**
[
\text{docswise_avg_accuracy} = \frac{\text{total thumbs_up}}{\text{total feedback_count}} \times 100
]

**Document Categories for Reports:**

* **Excellent:** > 81%
* **Good:** 71–80%
* **Average:** 50–70%
* **Poor:** < 50%

---

# **Slide 7: Feedback Submission Flow**

**Endpoint:** POST `/feedback_service`

**Process:**

1. Receive feedback JSON
2. Extract field-level feedback
3. Calculate:

   * feedback_count
   * thumbs_up_count
   * thumbs_down_count
   * docswise_avg_accuracy
4. Store record in database

**Response Example:**

```
{
  "message": "Data inserted successfully",
  "success": true,
  "details": {
    "feedback_id": 1,
    "application_id": "APP001",
    "feedback_count": 4,
    "thumbs_up_count": 3,
    "thumbs_down_count": 1,
    "docswise_avg_accuracy": 75.0
  }
}
```

---

# **Slide 8: Aggregated Report Flow**

**Endpoint:** GET `/aggregated_report`

**Input:**

* `application_id`
* `start_date`, `end_date`

**Process:**

1. High-level statistics calculation:

   * Total documents
   * Count of documents by accuracy category (>81%, 71–80%, etc.)
2. Field-level feedback calculation:

   * Accuracy per field
   * Count of feedback entries per field
3. Combine results in single report

---

# **Slide 9: Aggregated Report Example**

```
[
  {
    "report_type": "high_level",
    "application_id": "APP001",
    "total_documents": 25,
    "greater_than_81": 10,
    "range_71_to_80": 6,
    "range_50_to_70": 7,
    "less_than_50": 2,
    "Accuracy_rate": {
      ">81%": 40.0,
      "71–80%": 24.0,
      "50–70%": 28.0,
      "<50%": 8.0
    }
  },
  {
    "report_type": "Field_Level_Details",
    "application_id": "APP001",
    "Field_Name": {
      "Bo_Name": {
        "Field_Level_Accuracy": 80.0,
        "Fild_level_docs_count": 10
      },
      "Country_of_residence": {
        "Field_Level_Accuracy": 60.0,
        "Fild_level_docs_count": 5
      }
    }
  }
]
```

# **Slide 10: Feedback Calculation Logic**

1. Iterate over all feedback fields
2. Count thumbs_up / thumbs_down per field
3. Calculate field-level accuracy
4. Calculate document-level accuracy
5. Categorize documents (>81%, 71–80%, etc.)
6. Log all operations

---

# **Slide 11: Logging**

* Tracks validation success/failure
* Tracks database operations
* Tracks report fetching
* Provides warnings for missing records

---

# **Slide 12: How to Use**

1. Start API server:

```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

2. Submit feedback via POST request
3. Fetch aggregated report via GET request

---

# **Slide 13: Summary**

* Collects field-level feedback
* Calculates document and field accuracy
* Categorizes documents for quick insight
* Provides structured high-level & detailed reports
* Fully logged for traceability

---

This format **reads like a presentation**, with slides/sections and step-by-step flow.

If you want, I can **create a visual diagram for the flow** (submission → calculation → database → report) and make it look more like a real PPT slide.

Do you want me to create that diagram next?
 the code and raised the PR, adding you and Rupali for the code review. I’ve also sent the output of the high-level and field-level reports in JSON — please check and let me know if any changes are needed. The code has already been reviewed by Hrishikesh.
