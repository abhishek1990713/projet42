**Subject:** Clarification on `document_id` Mapping Issue

Hi Arvind,

I’m sending the screenshots of the input structure for both the high-level and field-level reports, along with the output JSON and a short document for your reference.

Arvind, I have one doubt regarding the `document_id` field. In the table, there is a column named `document_id`, but as Ruplai checked on the front end, it doesn’t seem to be mapped anywhere. Even when we submit the feedback, the `document_id` value is being inserted as zero.

Could you please check this?

Best regards,
**Abhishek**

Would you like me to make it a bit more formal or keep it conversational like this?
