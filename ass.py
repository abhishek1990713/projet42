**Subject:** Not Available for Today’s IDP Daily Scrum Call

Hi Arvind,

I wanted to inform you that I won’t be able to join today’s IDP daily scrum call due to food poisoning and a mild fever. I’m not feeling well and will be visiting the doctor’s clinic during that time.

For today’s update, I’ve completed the **nested-level feedback for the field-level report** and am currently working on the **wrapper part for the extracted data**.

Best regards,
**Abhishek**

Would you like me to make it slightly shorter or keep this detailed version?
