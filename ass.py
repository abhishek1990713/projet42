**Subject:** Leave Application for Marriage

Hi Arvind,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to inform you that I’ll be getting married on **28th November 2025**. I would like to take leave on **26th, 27th, 28th November**, and **1st & 2nd December**.

Additionally, since it includes the Citi mandatory leave, I’ll be taking a total of **5 days off**.

Please let me know if you need any further details or formalities from my side.

Best regards,
**[Your Name]**

Would you like me to make it sound a bit more **formal** or **friendly/informal** (since it’s a personal occasion)?
